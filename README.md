First, you are greeted by a login screen.

Then, you are presented with maps that show the availability of parking spaces.

 If we click on an occupied parking space, we are informed of the occupant's address, the time spent, and the price.

Finally, if a parking space is scanned with a QR code and is available, it changes to occupied status, and a timer is started. If the parking space is occupied, it indicates that the user is leaving the parking spot, and after completing the payment with a credit card, it changes to available status.
